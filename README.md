# Smooth Scrolling with Jump.js

Web-page with smooth scrolling using Jump.js 

## WTF is this?

Based on Gary Simons video [SMOOTH SCROLLING with Jump.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwNGfJu-T2k&t=487s) 
I built a webpage with smooth scrolling using Jump.js

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS
* NPM
* [Jump.js](http://callmecavs.com/jump.js/)

## What I learned
* How to install scripts and packages using npm install
* How to implement jump.js and customize it

## Problems/Mistakes
* Using npm command
* Had issue with making text and image be on one line next to each other. Fixed it by putting both in div and using flex

## License

Pretty much use it however you like.
